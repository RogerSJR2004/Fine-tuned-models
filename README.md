# 🧠 Roger’s Fine-Tuned LLMs Collection

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is a showcase of all the **language models I’ve fine-tuned** using **Hugging Face + Unsloth + LoRA**.
My focus is on building **lightweight, efficient, and instruction-following models** that can solve real-world problems in:

*  **Multi-language tasks** (Tamil + English)
*  **Summarization & Q\&A**
*  **Math & reasoning**
*  **Custom domain tasks** (finance, education, spiritual apps, etc.)

Each model here is uploaded to Hugging Face with an interactive demo, so you can try them directly.

## ✅ What’s Inside

* **TinyLlama Instruction Fine-Tuned v1** → (Q\&A, translation, summarization, reasoning)
* **Coming Soon**:

  * Tamil-English conversational model
  * Finance-focused instruction model
  * Bible AI assistant (Tamil + English)

---

## 🚀 Vision

I believe **small & efficient models** can have a massive impact when adapted to the **right domain**.
Instead of training billion-parameter models, my goal is to:

* Build **custom, domain-specific LLMs** for **education, finance, rural apps, and spiritual tools**.
* Share open-source models so others can **learn, experiment, and contribute**.
* Create **lightweight demos** that can run on limited hardware (GPUs/CPUs).

---

## 📊 Tech Stack

* **Base Models**: TinyLlama, Mistral, Llama-3 (planned)
* **Frameworks**: Unsloth, Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT, LoRA
* **Training**: Google Colab / Local GPU setups
* **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces (demo hosting)
